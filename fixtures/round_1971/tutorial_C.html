        <p>Place the twelve marks on a circle and map the numbers to their cyclic order. Two chords intersect strictly inside the circle if and only if one endpoint of the second chord lies between the endpoints of the first chord in the circular order and the other endpoint lies outside that interval.</p>
        <p>Thus, for chord <span class="math">(a, b)</span> sort the endpoints along the circle and check whether <span class="math">c</span> and <span class="math">d</span> fall on different sides of that arc. Repeat the same check when swapping the roles of the chords.</p>
