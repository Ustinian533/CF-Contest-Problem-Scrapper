        <p>The jumps before the last station are simply the distances <span class="math">x_1 - 0</span>, <span class="math">x_2 - x_1</span>, â€¦, <span class="math">x_n - x_{n-1}</span>.</p>
        <p>The final leg from <span class="math">x_n</span> to <span class="math">L</span> is counted twice. Therefore compute <span class="math">2 \cdot (L - x_n)</span> and compare it with all previous gaps.</p>
        <p>The answer is the maximum of those values.</p>
